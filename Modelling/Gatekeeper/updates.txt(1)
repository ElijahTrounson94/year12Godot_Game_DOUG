- Corrected spelling of "Grenade".
- Replaced NULL with TNT1.
- Converted sprites to PNG.

08/15/2017 - Ozymandias81:
- Crushed all PNG sprites, saved 50kbs circa
- Fixed several code indentations (spaces between rows, trimmage, caps etc)
- Added simplified inheritance for CubeTail#, PainTail#, Up#, Deathout and DSkulltail# actors
- Replaced with +BRIGHT flags those actors which had BRIGHT defined inside all their rows (unnecessary)

08/17/2017 - Doomedarchviledemon
- Fixed the offset for frame GATEF3F7 to match frame GATEE3E7 so that when looking at the monster from the side it is not jittering
- Reduced damage amounts of all the Gate Keeper's direct attacks
- Added Black Clouds to the Laser attack to add more variety
- Added the Gate Cube's ability to attack the player (Currently wip)
- Added GLDEFS to some of the GateKeeper's projectiles

03/17/2018 - Doomedarchviledemon
- Made the Gate Keeper's Cubes have a small change of exploding and spawning small black clouds

9/14/2020 - TheDoomedArchvile
- Cleaned the sprites a little to get rid of some white pixles
- Dark Lost Souls are no longer a Gatekeeper attack and instead spawns passively from the Shadow Cubes
- Lowered the Dark Lost Soul's health and attack for balance
